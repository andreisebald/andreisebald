### Hello there!
  Welcome to my github portfolio. Listed below are my favorite projects that I have worked on either in classes, exracurriculars or just out of self interest. Through the cultivation of these projects I have developed many techniques that can be applied to all different types of problems. I use this portfolio not only to demonstrate my capabilties, but also to have as a reference on future projects.  

  I'm so glad you have found my page! Please et me know if you have any questions. You can reach me on several platforms:
